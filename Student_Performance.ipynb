        "### General Observations Across Both Datasets\n",
        "1. **Age Range and Average**: Students in both datasets are in their mid to late teens (15-22 years), with a slightly higher average age in the second dataset (16.74 years) compared to the first (16.69 years).\n",
        "2. **Parental Education (Medu and Fedu)**: The mean values suggest that parents in the first dataset are generally more educated than those in the second dataset. The maximum value for mothers' and fathers' education is 4 in both datasets.\n",
        "3. **Study Time and Failures**: The first dataset shows a higher average of study time and failures. This could indicate either a more challenging curriculum or different evaluation standards.\n",
        "4. **Personal and Health Attributes (famrel, freetime, goout, Dalc, Walc, health)**: The averages of family relationship quality, free time, going out, weekday and weekend alcohol consumption, and health are similar in both datasets. The maximum value for all these attributes is 5, indicating a possible Likert scale measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Specific Observations for Each Dataset\n",
        "1. **First Dataset (Count: 395)**\n",
        "   - **Travel Time**: The average travel time is lower than the second dataset.\n",
        "   - **Absences and Grades (G1, G2, G3)**: There is a higher average number of absences and slightly lower average grades.\n",
        "   - **Standard Deviations**: Higher standard deviations in absences and grades suggest more variability in these areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Second Dataset (Count: 649)**\n",
        "   - **Travel Time**: Students have a higher average travel time.\n",
        "   - **Absences and Grades (G1, G2, G3)**: Students have fewer absences on average and slightly higher grades.\n",
        "   - **Standard Deviations**: Lower standard deviations in grades, indicating more consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Categorical Variables\n",
        "Both datasets include categorical variables such as school type, gender, address, family size, parent's job, reason for choosing the school, guardian, and various supports and activities. These variables can provide additional context for understanding differences in the numerical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Insights\n",
        "- The parental education levels, travel times, study habits, and academic performance differences suggest that the two datasets likely represent different populations or school environments.\n",
        "- The consistency in personal attributes and health across both datasets indicates similar student lifestyles or attitudes, regardless of the school type or other differentiating factors.\n",
        "- The variability in grades and absences, particularly in the first dataset, suggests a need to explore factors influencing academic performance and attendance."
